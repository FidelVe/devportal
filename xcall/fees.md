# Fees

When you're making a cross-chain call using xCall, there's a fee that covers the costs of sending the message between different blockchains. `sendCallMessage` is payable, so the fee should be included in the transaction. You can get the fee by calling `getFee`.

`getFee(String _net, boolean _rollback)` returns the total fee (relay + protocol) for sending a message to the specified network. If a rollback data is provided, the `_rollback` param should be set as true because there is an additional backward direction fee (from destination back to source) if rollback is used.

\
This fee is split into two parts:

**Relay Fee**: This fee is for the service that actually sends your message from one blockchain to another.&#x20;

**Protocol Fee**: This is the fee for using the cross-chain communication protocol underlying xCall.

### Relay Fee

* If a relay successfully delivers a cross-chain message, it can claim a reward. The first relay to successfully deliver a cross-chain message gets the reward.
* The reward claim can be made using the `claimReward` function, which requires the network address of the reward (`_network`) and the address of the receiver (`_receiver`).
* The accrued reward for each relay can be checked using the `getReward` function.

### Protocol Fee

* The protocol fee is set on the `xCall` contract by an admin wallet.

### Burning Fees and Impact to ICX Tokenomics

Native fees generated by protocol fees and relays managed by the ICON Foundation are swapped to native ICX and burned.
