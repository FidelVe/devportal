# BTP Development Instructions

## Setup and Installation

This section guides you through a setup of a Blockchain Transmission Protocol (BTP) connecting two networks. ICON and Moonriver networks would be used to demonstrate the scheme in this example. This document is aimed to support various groups of people who might be not developers but requires minimum knowledge of computer skills. As of now, we attempt to make these instructions as simple and detail as possible so everyone can do it manually and can be easy to catch up on. Please follow these instructions and do not skip any steps unless you understand what you are currently doing.

We have a script to make this example get easier. Please follow this instruction \[[link](https://github.com/icon-project/btp/blob/icondao/docker-compose/goloop2moonbeam/README.MD)] if you are interested in running via docker. Otherwise, please continue following instructions below

## Deployment Instructions

![](<../.gitbook/assets/deployment-module (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

The next following will provide instructions on how to deploy:

* Deploy a node in ICON's network
* Deploy a node in Moonriver's network
* Deploy smart contracts on ICON's network
* Deploy smart contracts on Moonriver's network
* Deploy the BTP Message Relay (BMR)

**Attention:** The deployments and settings might have some dependencies, which mean that one setting/deployment must complete prior another ones. Hence, please follow the below order to completely and safely deploy and set up configurations. If you mess up or skip one step, it might affect your deployment and setting which, in fact, lead to failure consequence

### Create Blockchain Nodes

#### 1. Deploy ICON Node

![](<../.gitbook/assets/deploy-icon-node (1) (1) (1).png>)

* Preparation

```bash
mkdir BTPExample && cd BTPExample

PROJECT_DIR=${PWD}

# Clone project
git clone https://github.com/icon-project/btp.git

cd $PROJECT_DIR/btp

git checkout icondao
```

* ICON's configuration files are located in `$PROJECT_DIR/btp/docker-compose/goloop2moonbeam/goloop/config`. You can modify these files for your settings
  * `icon.genesis.json`: ICON's genesis configuration file
  * `goloop.server.json`: ICON's node configuration file
  * `goloop.keystore.json`: node's keystore
  * `goloop.keysecret`: node's password key
* Run below commands to make `btpsimple-image`:

```bash
cd $PROJECT_DIR/btp

make btpsimple-image
```

* Start ICON's Node

```bash
cd $PROJECT_DIR/btp/docker-compose/goloop2moonbeam

docker-compose up goloop
```

#### 2. Deploy Moonriver Node

![](../.gitbook/assets/Deploy-MOONRIVER-Node.png)

A node on Moonriver can be easily deployed by running the below command:

```bash
cd $PROJECT_DIR/btp/docker-compose/goloop2moonbeam

docker-compose up moonbeam
```
