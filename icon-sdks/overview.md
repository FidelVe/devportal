# Overview

## ICON SDKs

Every ICON node provides JSON-RPC APIs. To talk to an ICON node, you can send raw JSON-RPC request, or, even better, use ICON SDKs in various languages. ICON officially supports Java, Python, JavaScript, and Swift.

* [ICON JSON-RPC v3 Specification](../references/reference-manuals/icon-json-rpc-api-v3-specification.md)
* [Java SDK](java-sdk/)
* [Python SDK](python-sdk/)
* [JavaScript SDK](javascript/)
* [Swift SDK](swift-sdk/)

Also, T-Bears provides CLI commands implementing JSON-RPC APIs. T-Bears CLI is a handy tool to test your score quickly without a single line of code during initial test.
