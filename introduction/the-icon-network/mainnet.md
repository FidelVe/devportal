**NOTICE: New PYTHON SCOREs will not be allowed anymore in ICON 2.0. If you are starting a new project, please use Java. If you are already working on python SCOREs for a while and do not have the resources to switch to Java before ICON 2.0, please let use know in **[**this thread**](https://forum.icon.community/t/python-score-migration-to-java/2227)** before ICON 2.0 mainnet launch.**

Before you submit your SCORE to the ICON mainnet, you should test thoroughly on T-Bears and Sejong testnet. **Please provide integration tests result on Sejong (function calls with parameters and Sejong transaction hashes).**

Note that SCORE audit is not enabled in testnet. Please make sure you understand the ICON audit policy and follow the guidelines.
